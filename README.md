### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure is to implement proper testing techniques throughout the development process. To start, I would perform unit testing on individual modules or functions to make sure as many lines of code written are operating correctly and without errors. Next, I would perform integration and system tests to make sure each module works properly with the program as a whole. Finally, I would work through my acceptance testing to confirm it is functional in the eyes of the end-user and not just the established requirements.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting and incorporating user needs into a program fall into the requirements gathering stage. Ensuring we are collecting the right information from the client or end-user is the first step in the process. We can have specific documents to track and manage the collected requirements. While incorporating it into a program, we must perform verification and validation checks throughout the entire lifecycle. The verification process ensures the software meets the requirements set out for the project and the validation process evaluates the current product to the userâ€™s needs.

### How do I approach designing software?

My design approach has changed throughout this course. I used to just write code to meet the requirements and perform tests afterward. Now I will try to start designing and developing software with a test-driven development approach. The idea of focusing on writing code to pass tests that are designed only to meet requirements is a great approach to limit unneeded and overcomplicated processes. Like most people, I tend to get carried away with wanting to create the best and sometimes over complicated functions or code. But, using the test-driven development method will help reign that in and keep me on track with producing simple, clean, and functional code.
